Q: How do I register for the event?

	Registration for the events has to be done from Kshitij’s website. For the exact procedure, check www.ktj.in

Q: Is there any abstract submission for the event?

	No abstract submission is required.

Q: How many members can be there in a team?

	Each team can have a maximum of four members.

Q: Can I use any method for OCR (Optical Character Recognition)?

	Yes. Any method can be used for OCR. You can use any machine learning library to use a known classifier for detecting characters. Otherwise image processing techniques such as template matching can also be used.

Q: Are we supposed to find out the maximum / minimum expressions only?

	For the first and round second round, you will be required to find out either the maximum or the minimum expression. In the third round, you will need to make a valid equation.

Q: Do I need to bring my own marker during the event?

	No it is not required. We will provide you with a marker. You can also bring your own markers to localize your robots.

Q: How will the characters be oriented according to the overhead camera?

	The orientation of the characters will be upright and straight from the camera feed. This orientation will not change during the course of a run.

Q: Will I be given time for thresholding (localization etc) before a run?

	Yes. You will be given sufficient time before a run (~20 mins) to make thresholding changes.

Q: What if my robot goes over an arbitrary character before it reaches the correct character?

	In that case, the arbitrary character won’t be taken into consideration of the final expression / equation. A character will only be considered when the robot flashes a red L.E.D. once it reaches a character.

Q: Is hard coding allowed?

	NO! We will check your codes before your run. If hard coding is detected, your run will not be considered.

Q: Do I have to make the robot wired / wireless?

	It is your choice. Both are allowed. In case you are making a wired robot, we will be providing you with USB extenders.

Q: What is the model of the overhead camera?

	Logitech B910 HD Webcam / Genius WideCam F100
