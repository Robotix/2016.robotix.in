### Introduction

Time is money, efficiency defines our lives, yet menial work is a necessary evil. What if all menial work could be completed by a literal flick of your wrist or snap of your fingers?

### Problem statement

Build a gesture controlled semi-autonomous robot that is capable of sorting blocks on multi-layered platforms according to their RFID tags.

### USP

* **RFID Tag Detection.**

* **Picking mechanism.**

* **Gesture Controlled Traversal.**

#### General Arena Description & Event Setup

1. The semi-autonomous robot movement and traversal has to be a **gesture controlled** (with no buttons or any keyboard), preferably using a Touchpad.
2. There will be multiple **5 cm blocks**, each with a particular **RFID tag**.
3. The “center platform” consists of three parts. There are two lower platforms which are **1 cm** above ground level due to platform thickness, each and **50 cm X 10 cm** in dimension each. Between the two lower platforms is a raised platform at a height of **10 cm** above ground level including the platform thickness, and **50 cm X 30 cm** in dimension.
4. The “shelves” are on the four corners of the arena. They are **two-tiered.** The four lower shelves are called **‘1A, 2A, 3A, 4A’** each of which corresponds to a particular corner and it is **1 cm** above ground level due to the platform thickness. The upper shelves are called **‘1B, 2B, 3B, 4B’** corresponding to the lower shelf and it is **12 cm** above ground level including the platform thickness. Each shelf (lower and upper) is **20 cm X 20 cm.**
5. The bot must have a gripping mechanism which is capable of accessing blocks placed on both the levels. It must be able to pick and drop blocks on any of the eight shelves. (Preferably a forklift or a gripper along with rack and pinion mechanism).
6. Each block will have two strips beneath it (Like a railway track) which will be **0.5 cm wide and 1 cm high** in cross-section and the same length as the block (**5 cm**). This will create a vacant space of **4 cm X 1 cm X 5 cm** beneath the block. This has been done to allow bots using forklift mechanism to be able to pick the blocks from beneath. If you implement a forklift then it's forks can enter this gap and pick the block. You can also use a mechanism to grip from beneath.
7. The RFID tag on each block will be placed on the top. Each RFID tag gives a **unique alpha-numeric number** when you read it. This contain information as to which shelf the block belongs to among 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B. **You will be provided with the unique RFID number for each shelf at the time of the event and you can feed it into your robot.**
8. On the corner edge of every shelf there will be a **15 cm X 15 cm** square safe zone as shown in the diagram. While placing the block on any shelf the bot must ensure that the block is kept within the safe zone.
9. Some blocks will have RFID tags that do not correspond to any of the eight shelves and these blocks are to be placed anywhere on the “center-platform”. If they are already on the center-platform then they can be ignored.
10. **Two** of the four corners will have **shelves with gates.**
11. The gates open when their corresponding **Infra-Red button** is activated. The button is located on the ground, **10 cm inward** from the arena border and **midway** between two adjacent shelves as shown.
12. The button consists of a Infra Red proximity based sensor. It is activated when the bot stops in front of it for **3 seconds.** Once activated, the corresponding gates of the both shelves of the corresponding corner are opened for a total of **30 seconds** each. The bot must pick/drop the block in that duration and should not touch the gates at any time.
13. The gates can be closed immediately before the 30 second are over if the bot goes and stops over the button for another **2 seconds** within that 30 second countdown.
14. The gates can then be reopened after it has been closed by activating the button again.
15. The event ends when the user has placed **all the blocks correctly** on their corresponding shelves and leaving those blocks which do not correspond to any shelf on the central platform. **All the gates must also be closed.**
16. Some blocks will be placed on a shelf at the start of the event and they must be **checked if they are on the correct shelf.** They must be moved to the centre-platform if their RFID number belongs to none of the eight shelves and if it does belong to a certain shelf then it must be placed on that shelf.

### Rounds

#### Round 1

1. The Bot will start from the Start zone which will be a **30 cm x 30 cm** square on any one adjacent side of the Arena.
2. The bot then has to pick and place all the 6 given blocks from their initial position to whichever shelf it belongs to.
3. The blocks in round 1 will belong to shelves **‘1A, 2A, 3A, 4A’** only. No block will belong to Zone B.
4. There will be **two** dummy blocks which won’t be transmitting any shelf id and hence must be placed **anywhere** on the center platform. If those blocks are on a shelf, then they must be picked and placed on the center platform.
5. The bot has to traverse the arena and reach the blocks by Gesture control.
6. Upon reaching the block the bot must pick it up using a gesture controlled gripper or forklift mechanism.
7. Then the bot has to read the information received from the RFID and **must display** it through a device, and then proceed towards depositing the block to it’s corresponding shelf. The indication is necessary for the user to know where to take the block.
8. A maximum of **2** timeouts and **2** restarts can be taken in this round. However a restart will be granted in the event of a technical failure only and will be based on Team ROBOTIX discretion.
9. A maximum of **4** minutes will be given to complete this round. The restart will only be given before **3** minutes into the round.
10. The round ends when the bot **returns** to the start zone after completing the task.

#### Round 2

1. The Bot will start from the Start zone which will be a **30 cm x 30 cm** square on any side of the square Arena.
2. The bot then has to pick and place all the **9** given blocks from their initial position to whatever shelf it belongs to.
3. The Blocks may belong to **any** of the Shelves, in **any** of the zones.
4. There will be **three** dummy blocks which won’t be transmitting any shelf id and hence must be placed **anywhere** on the center platform. If those blocks are on a shelf, then they must be picked and placed on the center platform.
5. The bot has to traverse the arena and reach the blocks by Gesture control.
6. Upon reaching the block the bot must pick it up using a gesture controlled gripper or forklift mechanism.
7. Then the bot has to read the information received from the RFID and display it through a device, and then proceed towards depositing the block to its corresponding shelf.
8. A maximum of **2** timeouts and **2** restarts can be taken in this round. However a restart will be granted in the event of a technical failure only and will be based on Team ROBOTIX discretion.
9. A maximum of **6** minutes will be given to complete this round. The restart will only be given before **4:30** into the round.
10. The round ends when the bot **returns** to the start zone after completing the task.
